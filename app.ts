//debugging is easier in this language because of static typing. It can catch type-related errors at compile time, which can help prevent runtime errors and make it easier to identify and fix issues in the code.


// a = "rohit"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

//conversion will take place although after compiling it will give error, means at any cost if it is convertible then it will convert

//Number


// let a: number = 10;

// let b: number = 20;

//string

let str:string= "Rohit";

//boolean
let isExist:boolean=true;
isExist=false;

//bigint

let bignumber:bigint=123456789362123n;


let names:string = "Mohan";
let honey:number = 20
